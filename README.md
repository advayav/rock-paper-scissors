This is a rock, paper, scissors game against the computer.
The computer randomly generates a move every round, while the user inputs what they would like their move to be for that round. If the computer wins, a point gets added to the computer's score, while if the user wins, a point gets added to their score. The game consists of a total of 5 rounds, and a final winner is determined at the end, depending on whether the computer or the user wins more rounds.

The final output for the results is displayed on the webpage. All other output is in the console, not on the browser page itself. When prompted with the box to enter the input, do so and then right click on the page and click the inspect option. Navigate to the console tab, and you should be able to see your results.

Happy playing!
